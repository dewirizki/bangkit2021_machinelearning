# Plant Recommender app - Machine Learning
A project by yu bisa yu:) Machine Learning students

## Topology
- `/dataset`: things we get from Kaggle. Shoutout to people whose projects I referenced in `/docs/notul/2021-05-07 - Datasets.md`!
- `/docs`: things I need to explain. Go there for API-level explanation.
- `/lib`: Initially I made these to help mobile students. But it turns out that both of my models are going to be deployed on the cloud, so let Nisa handle that perhaps?
- `/model`: Saved models, in forms of HDL5 and SavedModel of TensorFlow.
- `/notebook`: Nisa and I trained here. Explanations are few, but the code should be clear enough for y'all.
- `/weights`: Model weights, just in case.

## Unimportant info

### Who runs this repo, and who is involved in this?
First of all, Nisa is the owner. Alvin is the other ML student. Both of them are running this repo to train models and prepare for deployment.
